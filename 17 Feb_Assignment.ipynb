    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "Ans : MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database that is designed to store a large scale of data and also allows you to work with that data very efficiently.\n",
    "      It is categorized under the NoSQL (Not only SQL) database because the storage and retrieval of data in the MongoDB are not in the form of tables. \n",
    "      \n",
    "      A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is\n",
    "      optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",
    "      when our data is document-centric and doesn't fit well into the schema of a relational database.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans :1) Document Model\n",
    "         MongoDB has been designed with developer productivity and flexibility in mind. It is a document-oriented database, which means that data is stored as documents, \n",
    "          and documents are grouped in collections. The document model is a lot more natural for developers to work with because documents are self-contained and can be treated as objects.\n",
    "         This means that developers can focus on the data they need to store and process, rather than worrying about how to split the data across different rigid tables.\n",
    "     2) Sharding\n",
    "         Sharding is the process of splitting larger datasets across multiple distributed instances, or “shards.” When applied to particularly large datasets, sharding helps the database distribute and better execute what might otherwise be problematic and cumbersome queries. \n",
    "         Without sharding, scaling a growing web application with millions of daily users is nearly impossible.\n",
    "     3) Replication \n",
    "        Replication allows you to sidestep these vulnerabilities by deploying multiple servers for disaster recovery and backup. Horizontal scaling across multiple servers greatly increases data availability, \n",
    "        reliability, and fault tolerance. Potentially, replication can help spread the read load to the secondary members of the replica set with the use of read preference.\n",
    "     4) Authentication\n",
    "         Authentication is a critical security feature in MongoDB. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the database. Without authentication, \n",
    "        anyone can access your data.\n",
    "Q3. Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans : import pymongo\n",
    "      client = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb+srv://roshang441:Roshan143@cluster0.mokzdkc.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority\")\n",
    "      db = client.test\n",
    "      db = client['pwskills']\n",
    "      coll_pwskills = db[\"My records\"]\n",
    "Q4. Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record,\n",
    "and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.\n",
    "Ans : coll_pwskills.insert_one(data)\n",
    "      coll_pwskills.insert_many(data2)\n",
    "      coll_pwskills.find_one()\n",
    "      for i in coll_pwskills.find({'name': 'roshan'}):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "      \n",
    "Q5. Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to\n",
    "demonstrate this.\n",
    "Ans : for i in coll_pwskills.find({'name': 'sudh'}):\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "Q6. Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.\n",
    "Ans : Using the sort() method will increase the readability of a query, which leads to a better understanding of a given dataset.\n",
    "      Not only that, sorted data will be used by developers to write more complex algorithms.\n",
    "    db.collection_name.find().sort({field_name: sort order})\n",
    "Q7. Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.\n",
    "Ans:   Delete_many()\n",
    "    Delete_many() is used when one needs to delete more than one document. \n",
    "    A query object containing which document to be deleted is created and is passed as the first parameter to the delete_many().\n",
    "    deleteOne() deletes the first document that matches the filter\n",
    "    MongoDB's db.collection.drop() is used to drop a collection from the database."
